1. The zipe file was password protected.
2. The password was based on password guessing.
3. The password of zips started with passwd{and the number of the file}
4. Mannually extracted the first zip which gave the zip file flag99.zip.
5. For rest of zip file used a script to get the flag.


import zipfile

for i in range(99,0,-1):
	file_name = 'flag'+str(i)+'.zip'
 	password = 'passwd'+str(i)
 	with zipfile.ZipFile(file_name) as file:
 		file.extractall(pwd = bytes(pswd, 'utf-8'))
		print(f"zip file {file} extracted !")
